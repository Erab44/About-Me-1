      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Currently I am an Equity Trader at an Investment Advisory in Downtown Seattle. What that means essentially is that my firm manages money for our clients and invests it in the stock markets.  I don't decide what to buy and sell, but I am responsible for actually <i>buying</i> and <i>selling</i> those stocks. In the past I've spent many years coaching high school football and lacrosse. When I'm not at Code Fellows learning you can probably find me in a few different places:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Golfing albeit not well</li>
        <li>Hiking around the PNW</li>
        <li>Reading books while listening to Enya (and similar type artists)</li>
        <li>Eating the yummiest food I possibly can</li>
      </ul>
